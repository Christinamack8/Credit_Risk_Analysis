# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
* Undersampling data using ClusterCentroids
* Overssampling using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE
* Compared machine learning models

## Results




Oversampling Model:




SMOTE Oversampling


Udersampling:




## Summary 

The Easy Ensemble Model detects the most high credit risk, however with low precision.  The other models show less accuracy.  Although all the models are not perfect, the Easy Ensemble model would be the suggested model to choose.
